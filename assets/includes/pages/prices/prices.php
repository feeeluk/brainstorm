                Some services are not as 'time-boxable' as others, and therefore not as easy to block book in advance, e.g. Project Management services, or when creating a Proof of Concept solution.
                In these situations we are happy to bill time ad-hoc, but still within the bounds of this framework.

                For more details please refer to each service's respective pricing section.

                We can of course tailor prices 'off-menu' - which we can discuss in our initial consultation - however this framework still serves as a useful guide.
