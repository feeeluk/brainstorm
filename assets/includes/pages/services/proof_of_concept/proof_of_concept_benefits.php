            <h4>Clarity in decision-making</h4>

            <P>
                Business analysts help you make sense of complexity. They collect and analyze data, gather input from team members or customers, and present insights that lead to informed, strategic decisions.
            </P>
            
            <h6>Example: Should you invest in a new marketing tool or expand your team? A business analyst can weigh the pros and cons using real data.</h6>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Improving efficiency and saving money</h4>

            <P>
                Business analysts spot inefficiencies in processes — things like wasted time, money, or effort — and recommend ways to streamline them.
            </P>

            <h6>Example: Are customers waiting too long for support? A business analyst might suggest automation or workflow improvements.</h6>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Reducing risk</h4>

            <P>
                Business analysts help identify potential problems before they happen, or at least before they become costly.
            </P>

            <h6>Example: Launching a new product without understanding your target audience could flop. A business analyst researches customer needs to reduce that risk.</h6>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Boosting customer satisfaction</h4>

            <P>
                Through user research, feedback, and data analysis, Business analysts help businesses discover what customers truly want.
            </P>

            <h6>Example: Why are people abandoning their shopping trolleys near the checkout? A business analyst might discover issues with the checkout process that means it takes too long for some customers, and suggest system or process changes that result in reduced checkout times.</h6>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h4>Supporting growth and innovation</h4>

            <P>
                Business analysis isn't just about fixing problems — it's also about spotting opportunities.
            </P>

            <h6>Example: If you're thinking of expanding into a new market, business analysis helps determine if it’s viable and how to do it effectively.</h6>
